Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional 20-20 cricket tournament in India under BCCI. IPL is consist of almost all popular players all around the world.  Best player become a part of a team based on the official auction. Team franchises can acquire the players during the auction by paying the auction money. The base price of the players are fixing based on their ranking and other ratings. Obviously, franchises pay higher salaries for quality players based on their past performance, current match form and match fitness. So analyzing the players based on past performances and ranking them will help the franchisees to choose the best players at best price.
Here the performance measures and other sports parameters of the players during the session 2012 is given in the datasets. Record of these parameter are available in two different data set. Past record of batsmen are stored and available in the dataset “batting_bowling_ipl_bat.csv” and the record of bowing related parameters of bowlers are given in the dataset “batting_bowling_ipl_bowl.csv”. Here we need to conduct Principal component analysis on these dataset separately and we need to rank the plays based on the principal component analysis scores.


The objective is to use principal component analysis (PCA) to rank the batmen and bowlers based on the IPL-2012 session’s performance data. The recorded values of performance parameters of batsmen and bowlers are available in the datasets “batting_bowling_ipl_bat.csv” and “batting_bowling_ipl_bowl.csv” respectively. Here we need to perform the principal component analysis on these two data set independently and rank those players based on the PCA score. Here as a part of principal component analysis (PCA) we need to perform the following steps:
     1	Interpret loadings

     2	Interpret Communality

     3	Number of components to be retained

     4	Total variance extracted

     5	Check whether rotation is necessary

     6	Label the components

     7	Use the PC Scores to rank the players
