#  IPL Player Ranking, Household expenditure prediction and Bank Marketing Campaign

#1.	ANOVA – Bank Marketing Campaign
Part of new product introduction a bank conducted a market campaign among its customers. Bank targeted 20000 (twenty thousand) customers and collect data from them. The      collected data is contained in the data set PL_X_SELL in CSV format. We need to conduct the analysis of variance on the variables occupation of the customers and gender of the customer against the average quarterly balance of the customer.

  a.	Conduct a one-way ANOVA analysis to study whether the occupation of the account holder affects quarterly average balance in the account
  
  b.	Conduct two-way ANOVA analysis on gender and occupation on quarterly average balance.

#2.	LINEAR REGRESSION - Household expenditure
The dataset has information on monthly expenditure, annual income of the household, monthly income, household size (number of members in the household), and monthly EMI. So we need to set up a perfect regression model to explain the monthly expenditure using other variables or features in the dataset. This regression model can further use for most efficient prediction of monthly expenditure based on the other variables selected in the model. Here we need to set up a best-fit regression model based on a regression equation and need to calculate the fittest and balanced coefficient values corresponding to the regressor variables.

#3.	PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS – IPL Player Ranking
The objective is to use principal component analysis (PCA) to rank the batmen and bowlers based on the IPL-2012 session’s performance data. The recorded values of performance parameters of batsmen and bowlers are available in the datasets “batting_bowling_ipl_bat.csv” and “batting_bowling_ipl_bowl.csv” respectively. Here we need to perform the principal component analysis on these two data set independently and rank those players based on the PCA score. Here as a part of principal component analysis (PCA) we need to perform the following steps:

a.	Interpret loadings

b.	Interpret Communality

c.	Number of components to be retained

d.	Total variance extracted

e.	Check whether rotation is necessary

f.	Label the components

g.	Use the PC Scores to rank the players
