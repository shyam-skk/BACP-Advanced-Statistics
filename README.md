#  IPL Player Ranking using PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS

The objective is to use principal component analysis (PCA) to rank the batmen and bowlers based on the IPL-2012 session’s performance data. The recorded values of performance parameters of batsmen and bowlers are available in the datasets “batting_bowling_ipl_bat.csv” and “batting_bowling_ipl_bowl.csv” respectively. Here we need to perform the principal component analysis on these two data set independently and rank those players based on the PCA score. Here as a part of principal component analysis (PCA) we need to perform the following steps:

a.	Interpret loadings

b.	Interpret Communality

c.	Number of components to be retained

d.	Total variance extracted

e.	Check whether rotation is necessary

f.	Label the components

g.	Use the PC Scores to rank the players
